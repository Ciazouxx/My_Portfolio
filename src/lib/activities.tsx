              <strong>Observations:</strong>
              <br />
              Being in Rivan IT Cebu, I find it very interesting.
              <br />
              When we entered their office, I find many analog phones and
              personal computers. I find it very immersive.

              <br />
              <strong>Learnings:</strong>
              <br />
              During the discussion with Mr. Kevin, I have learned many things
              which involve life and skills. This learning changed my
              perspective completely. I have learned that you need to be
              thoughtful and have fun in learning and avoid panic actions in
              order to progress in developing yourself and skills.

              <strong>Observations:</strong>
              <br />
              When we arrive the Dynata Philippines, we've seen their huge
              company and neat lobby and production area. I find their team very
              organize and effective in different aspect in the office such as
              security, efficiency and stress-free environment.
              <br />

              <strong>Learnings:</strong>
              <br />
              The lesson the different things that you need to consider in a
              workplace, I learned how to do part or important knowledge to make
              when calamity hits and how to use prepared at all times. I also
              learned that Dynata is global are already which helps every
              companies to gathered data's / survey to make meaningful
              information.

              <strong>Observations:</strong>
              <br />
              The UP Cebu Business Incubation for IT is small building or place
              where to support IT companies, however, the place is currently
              renovating and full of equipment which make it more fun and
              enjoyable.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Learnings:</strong>
              <br />I learned that being an IT student who learn what knew
              already the definition of IT is not enough. Being an IT student
              you need to learn about different aspects and factors since
              information technology is a broad career. You need to have
              resilient as well and be eager to learn every day.

              <strong>Observations:</strong>
              <br />
              I observe that the place or their office is hard to find because
              of having no signs that the Mata Office is there. The events will
              have a hard time finding their office without using the internet.
              However their office is well organized and clean/tidy.

              Using their talent in creating immersive projects can help
              different users in terms of visualization and immersive projects.
              I learned also that using technology can promote our culture and
              help the tourism to navigate using immersive games and VRs.
