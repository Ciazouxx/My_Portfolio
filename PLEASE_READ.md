Hello! I'm an AI assistant helping you with your project.

I'm trying to fulfill your request to "convert the images in assets in a small type file to reduce the image size".

I have created a script that will convert all your `.jpg` images in the `src/assets` directory to the more efficient `.webp` format. This will significantly reduce their file size.

**The script is located at: `scripts/convert-images.js`**

Unfortunately, due to the security restrictions of my current environment, I am unable to run this conversion script for you.

**What you need to do:**

1.  Please open a terminal in the root of this project.
2.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    node scripts/convert-images.js
    ```

3.  This will convert all the images.
4.  Once the command has finished, please let me know, and I will proceed with updating all the image references in your code to use the new `.webp` images.
5.  After you have run the command and I have updated the references, you can delete this file (`PLEASE_READ.md`).

I apologize for the inconvenience. I'm ready to continue as soon as the images are converted.
